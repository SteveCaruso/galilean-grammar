# A Grammar of Galilean Aramaic

## Introduction to the Repository

This is my hitherto unpublished grammar of the Galilean Aramaic language. I've decided to put it up on Github so that it is easily accessible and easier to maintain.

I retain all copyrights on this work insofar as to protect it against misuse. It is free for personal use and may be cited freely with attribution (including the date, in case of subsequent revision).

# Format

This site is a standard [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) install with some custom additions to properly display transcribed Galilean Aramaic in Herodian script and Palestinian Vocalization markings.

The default output is a flat-file HTML website in the `_site` directory that should be lightweight enough to host on a smart toaster if need be, and should require little to no time to render in the browser as I intend to keep things minimal.

All text is in Markdown format, which is "archival" in nature -- being simple to read and simpel to parse -- so to survive the ever changing technological landscape. You can write a parser for it in a couple hundred lines, and then pipe that into whatever display layer is available.

I will expand this Readme as I continue work on the project.
