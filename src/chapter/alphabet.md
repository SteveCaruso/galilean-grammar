title: Vocalization
---

It must be stressed that the vocalizations in this volume seek to preserve as many attested features as feasible along with reasonable reconstructions. They are not exhaustive, nor are they indicative of every subdialect or known example that may be out "in the wild." Due to the messy nature of the Galilean corpus, there will always be additional variations to consider. Regardless, to better understand the dialect we will be focusing very heavily upon vocalization.

The *primary* reason why vocalization is so integral to the structure of this book is to aid with learning the language. Fluency is attained not only through reading and writing, but also through the muscle memory inherent to speaking and hearing a language regularly.

The *secondary* reason is due to the lack of standardization in spelling. Where we are trying to work from the most reliable forms of both spelling and vocalization, due to the aforementioned variances "in the wild," a student will be better equipped to identify, parse, and interpret non-standardized forms when they have a good grasp of what lies underneath them.

Historically, when it came to vocalizing a consonantal text, a scribe would have to employ a great deal of foreknowledge of both the language and the script. Ambiguities between different consonantal sounds and the presence and quality of vowels were originally memorized by rote, and any ambiguities were resolved by context. However, beginning in the 6th and 7th centuries CE, we start seeing Vocalization Systems begin to evolve, whereby a number of other important features about pronunciation are represented by written notation.

For Jewish Aramaic, there were three major systems: Tiberian, Babylonian, and Palestinian. Tiberian was a sublinear system, where vowels were predominantly expressed by a number of dots and dashes under the letters they came after, where Babylonian and Palestinian were supralinear, the notation predominantly above the letters like Syriac and Arabic. Each represented a different number of vowels and a different number of features that their scribes thought were important to keep track of. Eventually, the Tiberian school won out, and is what was used to write not only Jewish Aramaic, but Hebrew up to the modern day. It managed to keep track of the typical number of features that Hebrew and Eastern Aramaic dialects needed to keep track of.

Galilean, however, was not a typical Eastern Aramaic dialect. Where vocalization markings in the Galilean corpus are relatively rare, a small number of documents appear with *Palestinian Vocalization* markings (predominantly among the Palestinian Piyyutim and various Genizah Fragments^[Of which Fassberg (1990) gives a comprehensive analysis.]) or *Palestino-Tiberian Vocalization*^[This inelegant method is well-explained in Heijmans' article of the same name in \cite{hebrewEncyclopedia}.] (that is, a Palestinian system expressed by Tiberian notation). All of these examples demonstrate a number of distinct features.

There was considerable ambiguity between the classical *patah* (a) and *qametz* (å) vowels as well as *segol* (e) and *tsere* (ē). Very often (especially in earlier Galilean) the two were not differentiated, which left the inventory of nominal Galilean vowels at 5 (*a, e, i, o, u*) plus *shwa* (*ə*), which it shared with Palestinian Hebrew.^[For more on Palestinian Hebrew's vocalization, see \cite{yahalom1997}.]

Vowels between labial consonants -- even if classical *shwa* -- tended to trend towards {% gal "w" %}.

Additionally, there are a number of written accounts by contemporaries that described how Galileans spoke:

From anecdotes in the Babylonian Talmud, Galileans tended to pronounce {% gal ")" %}, {% gal "h" %}, {% gal "x" %}, and {% gal "(" %} similarly at the beginning of a word and reduce many initial and/or unstressed vowels to *šəwa*.^[The anecdote about a certain Galilean asking for an {% gal ")mr" %} in *Talmud Bavli, Erub. 53b* hyperbolically suggests that Galileans pronounced {% gal "xmr" %} *ḥămār* (wine), {% gal "xmr" %} *ḥămar* (donkey), {% gal "(mr" %} *`ămar* (wool), and {% gal ")ymr" %} *'immar* (lamb) identically. Galileans were not "precise in their speech." In the same passage there are other anecdotes about how Galileans pronounced  {% gal ")" %} like {% gal "(" %} and vice versa.]

Despite this, from New Testament evidence we see that {% gal "(" %} in early Galilean was voiced in some contexts. In Mark 3:17 we find the transliterated phrase βοανηργες, which is likely to be either {% gal "bny-r($" %} ^[This author's reconstruction. {% gal "r($" %} is a word which occurs only in Galilean and Late Jewish Literary Aramaic which means "to rumble." A striking example appears in the poem {% gal ")zd(z( (lmh" %} (*"The Shaking of the World"*) which reads: {% gal "wr($ thwmh byrtt w)ym)" %} = "And the Abyss *rumbled* with trembling and fright." This was ultimately clarified as "thunder."] or {% gal "bny-r(M" %}.^[\citet{casey1999} argues that {% gal "M" %} was misread for {% gal "s" %} which is, perhaps, one of the most elegant explanations.] Here we see {% gal "(" %} transliterated by γ which also happens in the Septuagint.^[ex. γομορρα = {% gal "(mwrh" %} = "Gomorrah."]

Further examples of directly transliterated Galilean Aramaic from the New Testament include:

> **ταλιθα κουμι** (Mark 5:41) = "Girl, arise!"  
> &nbsp; ⟶ {% gal "+lyth qwmy" %} ⟶ *təliṯáh qúmi*  

> **εφφαθα** (Mark 7:34) = "Be opened."  
> &nbsp; ⟶ {% gal ")ptx" %} < {% gal ")ytptx" %} ⟶ *'ə(ṯ)faṯáḥ*

> **αββα** (Mark 14:36, Romans 8:15, Galatians 4:6) = "Father" / "My father"
> &nbsp; ⟶ {% gal ")bh" %} ⟶ *'əbbáh*

> **ρακα** (Matthew 5:22) = "Idiot"
> &nbsp; ⟶ {% gal "ryqh" %}/{% gal "rqh" %} ⟶ *rəqáh*

> **ραββουνει** (John 20:16) = "My teacher/master."
> &nbsp; ⟶ {% gal "rbwny" %} ⟶ *rabbúni*

> **ηλει ηλει λεμα σαβαχθανει** (Matthew 27:46) = "My God, my God, why have you left me?" 
> &nbsp; ⟶ {% gal ")ly )ly lmh $bqtny" %} ⟶ *'əlí 'əlí ləmáh šəváqtani*

> **ελοι ελοι λιμα σαβαχθανει** (Mark 15:34) = "My God, my God, why have you left me?" 
> &nbsp; ⟶ {% gal ")lhy )lhy lmh $bqtny" %} ⟶ *'əlahí 'əlahí ləmáh šəváqtani*

> **κορβαν** (Matthew 27:6, Mark 7:11) = "Offering/sacrifice."
> &nbsp; ⟶ {% gal "qwrbN" %} ⟶ *qorbán*

From these examples, as well as from Greek transliterations of names (both within and outside of the New Testament) we can see the ongoing process of vowel reduction was underway in early Galilean, but that it was not nearly as marked as it was in Eastern dialects such as Syriac.^[See \cite{kaufman1984}]

## Palestinian Vocalization Markings

Because of the reduced vowel inventory and the fact that it is found predominantly with Palestinian Aramaic and Palestinian Hebrew, *Palestinian Vocalization* markings have been chosen to express vocalizations in this volume. The Tiberian and Babylonian Vocalization systems, as they are meant to be used, do not properly "fit" Galilean pronunciation without some "shoehorning";^[Regrettably what we see in \cite{sokoloff1992} with Tiberian.] however, Palestinian Vocalization in and of itself is not nearly as standardized. As such, we will adopt the following conventions:

| {% gal "):" %} | {% gal ")a" %} | {% gal "E" %} | {% gal "I" %} | {% gal "O" %} | {% gal "U" %} |
| :------------: | :------------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: |
| *ə*            | *a*            | *e*           | *i*           | *o*           | *u*           |
| *šəwah*        | *pəṯaḥ*        | *çəre*        | *ḥəriq*       | *qomaç*       | *qəfuç*       |

Out of all vowels, only the names of three have survived in the (later) Galilean corpus, those being *šəwah*,^[Damascus Pentateuch Masora, Num 3:21] *paṯaḥ*,^[*ibid.* Lev 27:29, Deut 31:23] and *qamaç*.^[*ibid.* Gen 41:5, Lev 27:29, Num 7:58, Deut 31:23] *Šəwah* and *pəṯaḥ* (sometimes *paṯaḥ*) have been clarified, and *qamaç* repurposed as *qomaç* (with a similar sound). The other three names have been adapted from contemporary terms to indicate how the vowels are formed.

> {% gal "):" %} - **Šəwah** (*Shwa*)^[Rarely, *šəwah* is represented by {% gal "y" %}, so we find forms like {% gal ")yb>ah" %} for {% gal "):b>ah" %} *'əbbah* ("father") or {% gal "byr" %} for {% gal "b:r" %} *bər* ("son") in the wild.] -- Two dots on the diagonal, it's like the *a* in "above"; a very short *uh*. It is represented in transliteration by *ə*.

> {% gal ")a" %} - **Pəṯaḥ** -- A line over the top of a letter, it is an open *ah* sound which could have been nazalized. It is represented in transliteration as *a*.

> {% gal "E" %} - **Çəre** -- Looks like a *yod* with a *shwa* over it. If it's at the beginning of a word, it's pronounced *yə*, but everywhere else it represents an *ey* sound. In transliteration it is represented by *e*.

> {% gal "I" %} - **Ḥəriq** -- A *yod* with two dots vertically aligned over it. It makes an *ee* sound. In transliteration it is represented by the letter *i*. 

> {% gal "O" %} - **Qomaç** -- A *wau* with three dots in a triangle over it. It makes an *oh* sound. In transliteration it is represented by the letter *o*; and finally,

> {% gal "U" %} - **Qəfuç** -- A *wau* with two dots side-by-side over it. It makes an *oo* sound. In transliteration it is represented by the letter *u*.

Stress is believed to have fallen upon the final full syllable, and in transliteration is represented by an acute accent on the appropriate vowel (*á, é, í, ó, ú*).

*Šəwa`* and *pəṯaḥ* can fall upon any letter, and when they do they are pronounced right after it. For example {% gal "k:tabah" %} = *kəṯaváh*.

When a vowel falls upon a {% gal "yy" %} or {% gal "ww" %} (representing a consonantal *y* or *w* respectively) it is written over it as if they are one letter.

## *Pəṯaḥ Gəniv*

| Examples: | {% gal "nOxa" %} | {% gal "rUxa" %} | {% gal "y;$U(a)" %} |
| :-------: | :--------------: | :--------------: | :-----------------: |
|           | *noaḥ*           | *ruaḥ*           | *yəšua`*            |
|           | "Noah"           | "spirit"         | "Jesus"             |

Due to the clustering of vowels, *pəṯaḥ* won't quite fit due to the presence of other diacritical marks. In these cases it is written on the last letter, but is still pronounced before it.^[In Tiberian Vocalization this can only happen on certain letters -- {% gal "h x ( )" %} etc. -- but in Palestinian Vocalization it even occurs on {% gal "ww" %} and {% gal "yy" %} such as in {% gal "b.nyyf" %} ⟶ *bənai*. (The {% gal "Xf" %} represents the Tiberian *qamaç* in later extended Palestinian systems.)] This is known as *pəṯaḥ gəniv* or a "stolen *pəṯaḥ*".

## Combinations & Diphthongs

These three letters are used in concert to express a large number of vowel combinations with slight variations depending on where they fall within a word. The following table shows the most common combinations:

\subsection{\textit{Dəḡeš} \& \textit{Rafe}}

When a letter is doubled in pronunciation and/or where one of the \textit{bəḡaḏkəfaṯ} is pronounced \textit{qəše} it can be noted by a \textit{dəḡeš} or "dagesh" (\Gal{X.}) over the appropriate letter (e.g. \Gal{kad.UN} = \textit{kaddun} "now" rather than \textit{kaḏun}). If at the beginning of a syllable, the \textit{dəḡeš} also indicates a \textit{šəwa`} directly after the letter it falls on provided no vowel follows it (otherwise, it is merely doubled and/or pronounced \textit{qəše}).\footnote{For example, we see some cases "in the wild" such as (again) \Gal{b.nyyf} ⟶ \textit{bənai} "(the) sons of."}

When one of the \textit{bəḡaḏkəfaṯ} is pronounced \textit{rafe} where one would expect it to be \textit{qəše} it is noted with a \textit{dəḡeš} turned 90 degrees clockwise (\Gal{X]}) like \Gal{malk]Utah} \textit{malḵuṯah} "the kingdom."

This \textit{rafe} mark can also be found on \Gal{h} when it appears at the end of a word but is pronounced as a noticable \textit{h} rather than simply indicating a final vowel (\Gal{h]}) like \Gal{k:tabah]} \textit{kəṯavaẖ} "her book."\footnote{This use "in the wild" is uncertain as it only possibly occurs twice. See \citet[§3d p.23]{fassberg1990} and follow the merry chase of endnotes.}

Most of the time, \textit{dəḡeš} and \textit{rafe} are more or less only used when it's necessary to disambiguate and are otherwise omitted.

\subsection{\textit{Gəreš}}

The cognate to the apostrophe in Palestinian notation is the \Gal{'} \textit{gəreš} (or "geresh"; plural \Gal{''} \Gal{ger\$IN} \textit{geršin}). It is generally used in three ways:

\begin{enumerate}
\item When letters are omitted (like an English apostrophe). In many Rabbinic texts it's common to find \Gal{)'} = \Gal{)mr} \textit{'əmar} ("he said").
\item To indicate numerals. \Gal{y'} = 10, \Gal{t''k} = 500. (See the chapter on Numerals for more.)
\item To indicate an acronym or initialism.
\end{enumerate}

In later Galilean texts, \textit{geršin} are sometimes placed around words in other languages or upon the first and last letters of quoted words much like quotation marks.
