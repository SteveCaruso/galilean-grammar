## Personal Pronouns

|               | Singular                       ||     | Plural                           ||      | 
| ------------- | --------------------: | :------ | :-: | ---------------------: | :-------- | :--: |
| **1st Com.**  | [^1]{% gal "):nah" %} | *'ənáh* | I   | {% gal "):naN" %}      | *'ənán*   | We   |
| **2nd Masc.** | {% gal ")at." %}      | *'át*   | You | {% gal ")at.ON" %}     | *'attón*  | You  |
| **2nd Fem.**  | [^2]{% gal ")at." %}  | *'át*   | You | {% gal ")at.EN" %}     | *'attén*  | You  |
| **3rd Masc.** | {% gal "hU)" %}       | *hú'*   | He  | [^3]{% gal "hEn.UN" %} | *hennún*  | They |
| **3rd Fem.**  | {% gal "hI)" %}       | *hí'*   | She | [^4]{% gal "hEn.IN" %} | *hennín*  | They |

[^1]: Variant: {% gal ")n)" %}.
[^2]: Rarely the archaic {% gal ")ty" %}.
[^3]: Variants: {% gal "hnwN" %} {% gal ")ynwn" %}.
[^4]: Variants: {% gal "hnyN" %}, {% gal ")ynyN" %}, vocalized once in the Piyutim as *'inin*, but this is probably due to the repetition of *çəre*.


In informal speech and writing, when given prefixes (see [Proclitic Particles](/chapter/particles)) the first letter of the Personal Pronoun is dropped (e.g. {% gal "wnh" %} *wənah* = {% gal "w:)nah" %} *wə'ənah*, {% gal "dynwN" %} *dennún* = {% gal "d:hEn.UN" %} *dəhennún*, etc.).

Where it is common in other dialects and goes counter to Galilean's largely phonetic system of spelling, *very rarely* one will see {% gal "hU)" %} or {% gal "hI)" %} without its final {% gal ")" %}. It only tends to happen with prefixes mentioned above, and this otherwise would be the only strong example of a "silent letter" employed in Galilean spelling.

In simple nominal sentences the Pronoun either proceeds or follows the object and can act as a copula ({% gal "):nah hU)" %} *'ənáh hú'* = "It's me").

## Demonstrative Pronouns

|                                      | Singular              |                   | Plural                 |                     |
| -----------------------------------: | :-------------------: | :---------------: | :--------------------: | :-----------------: |
|                                      | ***Masculine***       | ***Feminine***    | ***Masculine***        | ***Feminine***      |  
| **This**                             | [^5]{% gal "d:N" %}   | {% gal "dah" %}   | {% gal ")ElAyyiN" %}   | *(same)*            |
| *(Independent)*                      | *dən*                 | *dah*             | *'elaiyín*             |                     |
| **This**                             | [^6]{% gal "had:N" %} | {% gal "hadah" %} | {% gal "ha)ElAyyiN" %} | *(same)*            |
| *(Attributive)*                      | *haḏən*               | *haḏah*           | *ha'elaiyín*           |                     |
| **That**                             | {% gal "hahU)" %}     | {% gal "hahI)" %} | {% gal "hahEnUN" %}    | {% gal "hahEnEN" %} |
| *(Independent<br>& Attributive)*[^7] | *hahú'*               | *hahí'*           | *hahenún*              | *hahenén*           |


[^5]: Variant: {% gal "dyN" %}.
[^6]: Variant: {% gal "hdyN" %}
[^7]: Rare archaic forms: {% gal "hadaK" %} (c.s.); {% gal ")ylyK" %}, {% gal ")ylwK" %}, {% gal "hylyK" %}, and {% gal "hylwK" %} (c.pl.). These are seldom encountered.

Demonstrative pronouns come in two forms, Independent (used as a Noun, e.g. {% gal ")at. ba(E d:N" %} = "Do you want *this*?") and Attributive (used as an Adjective, e.g. {% gal "had:N sEprah" %} = "*this* book"). Attributive forms always precede the Nouns they modify which in turn must be in the Definite State.^[e.g. {% gal "had:N )Orxah" %} = "this path," never {% gal "had:N )Orxa" %} or {% gal ")Orxah had:N" %}. The only exception to this is in translational language, such as what is found in the Targums where the Attributive follows the Definite Noun it modifies; however, this is more a matter of preserving original word order in the translated document than a true expression of the vernacular.]

Galilean diexis (the relative positions of "this" and "that") is a bit different from that utilized in English. "This" covers things at hand as well as in the same general facility, regardless of contrast,^[{% gal "d:N wAd:N" %} = "this and that" where it is literally "this and this."] where "that" is far more distal and contrasted (more like "that one over there").^[Indeed, within the Galilean corpus, we find the strongest examples of "that" within court proceedings where each side refers to the other in marked opposition.]

## Interrogative Pronouns

|                 |       |         |
| -------------:  | :---- | :------ |
| {% gal "maN" %} | *man* | = Who?  |
| {% gal "mah" %} | *mah* | = What? |

Nearly half the time {% gal "maN" %} will be spelled {% gal "m)aN" %} and it can also be used in a non-Interrogative sense ("one who...").

When {% gal "mah" %} is followed by an Objective Pronoun, it takes on the meaning "What is the matter?" (ex. {% gal "mah lAK" %} = "What's (the matter) with you?").

When Demonstrative Pronouns are given the {% gal "hayy-" %} prefix, we get:

| Masculine                | Feminine            | Plural               |         |
| :---------------------:  | :-----------------: | :------------------: | :------ |
| [^11]{% gal "hayyd:N" %} | {% gal "hayydah" %} | {% gal "hayylEN" %}  | =Which? |
| *haiḏən*                 | *haiḏáh*            | *hailén*             |         |

[^11]: Variant spelling: {% gal "hyydyN" %}

## Other Interrogatives

Where most are not strictly Pronouns, there is seldom a better place to mention these than by the Interrogative Pronouns since some of them incorporate Interrogative Pronouns. Many times they can also be used in non-interrogative situations.

|                        |          |                   |
| ---------------------: | :------- | :---------------- |
| {% gal ")Im>at" %}     | *'immaṯ* | = When?           |
| [^12]{% gal "haN" %}   | *han*    | = Where?          |
| [^13]{% gal "l:mah" %} | *ləmah*  | = Why?            |
| [^14]{% gal "h:K" %}   | *həḵ*    | = How?            |
| [^15]{% gal "l:maN" %} | *ləman*  | = Whose? To whom? |

[^12]: Often spelled {% gal ")N" %}.
[^13]: Made from {% gal "l-" %} + {% gal "mh" %}.
[^14]: Sometimes spelled {% gal "hyK" %}.
[^15]: Made from {% gal "l-" %} + {% gal "maN" %}.
