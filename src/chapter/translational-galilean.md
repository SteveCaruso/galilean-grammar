\chapter{Translational Galilean}

Galilean Aramaic that is employed in translational context (such as in the \textit{Targums}) often incorporates a certain set of archaisms. In one sense these archaisms preserve features of the original language from which is being translated -- predominantly Classical Hebrew -- or are perhaps used for aesthetic reasons. These include:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The use of \Gal{yAt} instead of \Gal{l:-} to denote the Direct Object of a sentence.
\item Using long-hand forms such as \Gal{dI} and \Gal{kI} instead of their shortened proclitic forms (\Gal{d:-} and \Gal{k:-} respectively).
\item Placing Attributive Demonstrative Pronouns after the Nouns they modify.
\end{enumerate}
