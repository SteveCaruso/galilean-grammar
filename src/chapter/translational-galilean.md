title: Translational Galilean
---

Galilean Aramaic that is employed in translational context (such as in the *Targums*) often incorporates a certain set of archaisms. In one sense these archaisms preserve features of the original language from which is being translated -- predominantly Classical Hebrew -- or are perhaps used for aesthetic reasons. These include:

1. The use of {% gal "yAt" %} instead of {% gal "l:-" %} to denote the Direct Object of a sentence.

2. Using long-hand forms such as {% gal "dI" %} and {% gal "kI" %} instead of their shortened proclitic forms ({% gal "d:-" %} and {% gal "k:-" %} respectively).

3. Placing Attributive Demonstrative Pronouns after the Nouns they modify.
