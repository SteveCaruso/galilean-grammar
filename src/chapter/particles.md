\section{The Proclitic Particles (\textit{də-}, \textit{lə-}, \textit{bə-}, \textit{wə-}, \& \textit{kə-})}

~\\
\begin{tabu} to \textwidth {X[c] | X[c] | X[c] | X[c] | X[c]}

\end{tabu}
~\\

The Proclitic Particles are particles that are letters that are prefixed upon words that bestow additional meaning. The majority of them are prepositions and conjunctions.

\subsection{Notes About \textit{də-}}

Out of all of the Proclitic Particles, \textit{də-} is the most complex. It is a shortened form of the archaic \Gal{dI},\footnote{Which is only employed in translational texts, such as the Palestinian Targums.} it is a particle that has abundant use:

\begin{enumerate}
\item As a \textbf{Genitive Particle}, roughly equivalent to "of."\\
~\\
\Gal{sEprah d:malkah} \textit{sefráh \textbf{də}malkah} = "The book \textbf{of} the king."

\item As a \textbf{Relative Pronoun}, "who," "which," or "of whom."\\
~\\
\Gal{gabrah dA):tah}  \textit{gavrah \textbf{da}'əṯah} = "The man \textbf{who} came."

\item As a \textbf{Conjunction}, as "that," "so that," "because" or "for."\\
~\\
\Gal{xamEt dan:pal}  \textit{ḥaméṯ \textbf{da}nəfal} = "I saw \textbf{that} he fell".

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{With Pronominal Suffixes}

Out of the Proclitic Particles, only \Gal{l:-} and \Gal{b:-} can take on Pronominal Suffixes. The others are only found affixed to Nouns, Pronouns, and Verbs.

When \Gal{l:-} is combined with Pronominal Suffixes it represents the \textbf{Objective Pronoun}:

\begin{center}
\noindent\begin{tabu} to 3.5in {l c X[r] | X[l] c X[r] | X[l] c}
~			&~&	\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textit{Singular}}		&~&	\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textit{Plural}}	\\
1st Com.		&~&	\Gal{lI}	&"(to)~me"			&~&	\Gal{laN}		&"(to)~us"	\\
2nd Masc.		&~&	\Gal{laK}	&"(to)~you"			&~&	\Gal{l:kON}	&"(to)~you"	\\
2nd Fem.		&~&	\Gal{lEK}	&"(to)~you"			&~&	\Gal{l:kEN}	&"(to)~you"	\\
3rd Masc.		&~&	\Gal{lEh}	&"(to)~him"			&~&	\Gal{l:hON}	&"(to)~them"	\\
3rd Fem.		&~&	\Gal{lah}	&"(to)~her"			&~&	\Gal{l:hEN}	&"(to)~them"	\\
\end{tabu}
\end{center}

When \Gal{b:-} is combined with Pronominal Suffixes it represents \textbf{"with," "in,"} or \textbf{"through"} followed by the \textbf{Objective Pronoun}:

\begin{center}
\noindent\begin{tabu} to 3.5in {l X[r] | X[l] c X[r] | X[l] c}
~			&	\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textit{Singular}}		&~~~~&	\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textit{Plural}}	\\
1st Com.		&	\Gal{bI}	&"with/in~me"		&~~~~&	\Gal{baN}		&"with/in~us"	\\
2nd Masc.		&	\Gal{baK}	&"with/in~you"		&~~~~&	\Gal{b:kON}	&"with/in~you"	\\
2nd Fem.		&	\Gal{bEK}	&"with/in~you"		&~~~~&	\Gal{b:kEN}	&"with/in~you"	\\
3rd Masc.		&	\Gal{bEh}	&"with/in~him"		&~~~~&	\Gal{b:hON}	&"with/in~them"	\\
3rd Fem.		&	\Gal{bah}	&"with/in~her"		&~~~~&	\Gal{b:hEN}	&"with/in~them"	\\
\end{tabu}
\end{center}


\subsection{Multiple Prefixes}

Multiple Proclitic Particles can be added to the same word to express a variety of meanings. For example:

\Gal{malkah} $\rightarrow$ "the king"

\Gal{l:malkah} $\rightarrow$ "unto the king"

\Gal{dal:malkah} $\rightarrow$ "that which (is) unto the king"

\Gal{k:dal:malkah} $\rightarrow$ "like that which (is) unto the king"

\Gal{wAk:dal:malkah} $\rightarrow$ "and like that which (is) unto the king"

etc.

\subsection{The Rule of \textit{šəwa`}}

As you have probably noticed, as Proclitic Particles are added upon a word, the vowel alternates between \textit{šəwa`} and \textit{pəṯaḥ}. The rule of determining which is used can be condensed to "don't put two \textit{šəwa`}s in a row."\footnote{See \citet[§33, pp.107-110]{fassberg1990} for a full set of examples of this rule.} For example:

If the next syllable is a \textit{šəwa`}, use \textit{pəṯaḥ}. 

\Gal{m:lEK} "(a) king" $\rightarrow$ \Gal{lam:lEK} "to (a) king."

But if the next syllable has any other vowel use \textit{šəwa`}.

\Gal{malkah} "the king" $\rightarrow$ \Gal{l:malkah} "to the king."

As you can see from the examples in the previous section on Multiple Prefixes, you work backwards with each addition.

\section{Independent Particles}

There are also a number of particles that are separate from other words. [More stuff here.]

\subsection{\textit{mən}}

The particle \Gal{m:N} predominantly means "from" is used in a variety of ways that indicates a point of origin (\Gal{):nah m:N galIlah} = "I am from Galilee"). 

When it takes on suffixes, the vowel lengthens and the \textit{nun} doubles  (\Gal{mIn.-}) hence:

\begin{center}
\noindent\begin{tabu} to \textwidth {r c c c c}
~			&	\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textit{\textbf{Singular}}}	& \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textit{\textbf{Plural}}}			\\
1st Com.		&	\Gal{mIn.I} 			& \textit{minní}		&\Gal{mIn>aN}				& \textit{minnán}	\\
2nd	Masc.	&	\Gal{mIn>aK} 			& \textit{minnáḵ}	&\Gal{mIn.kON}			& \textit{minnəkón}	\\
2nd	Fem.		&	\Gal{mIn.EK}			& \textit{minnéḵ}	&\Gal{mIn.kEN}				& \textit{minnəkén}	\\
3rd	Masc.	&	\Gal{mIn.Eh} 			& \textit{minnéh}	&\Gal{mIn.hON}			& \textit{minnəhón}	\\
3rd	Fem.		&	\Gal{mIn>ah} 			& \textit{minnáh}	&\Gal{mIn.hEN}			& \textit{minnəhén}	\\
\end{tabu}
\end{center}

\noindent
It can also be used in a \textbf{partitive} sense.

...\Gal{xad m:N )axOI} = "One from/of his brothers."

...\Gal{t:rayyiN m:N s:qah} = "Three from the sack."

\noindent
It can also be used to express \textbf{superlatives} in the following manner.

...\Gal{rab m:N} = "Bigger/greater than..."

...\Gal{y;tIr m:N} = "More than..."

...\Gal{p:rah m:N} = "Less than..."\footnote{\Gal{p:rah} is a loan from the Greek \Grk{παρά}.}

...\Gal{z;(Or m:N} = "Smaller/less than..."

\noindent
And to express something the "biggest" or "smallest" it's always "from" a plural or "from all" (\Gal{m:N kal}):

...\Gal{rabah mIn.kON} = "The greatest among you."

...\Gal{z;(Or m:N kal} = "Smallest (of all)."


\subsection{\textit{`əm}}

The particle \Gal{(:M} indicates "(together) with" or "at the time of." When combined with Pronominal Suffixes, the \Gal{m} doubles:

\begin{center}
\noindent\begin{tabu} to 3.5in {l c X[r] | X[l] c X[r] | X[l] c}
~			&~&	\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textit{Singular}}		&~&	\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textit{Plural}}	\\
1st Com.		&~&	\Gal{(:m.I}		&"with~me"			&~&	\Gal{(:m>aN}	&"with~us"	\\
2nd Masc.		&~&	\Gal{(:m>aK}	&"with~you"			&~&	\Gal{(:m.kON}	&"with~you"	\\
2nd Fem.		&~&	\Gal{(:m.EK}	&"with~you"			&~&	\Gal{(:m.kEN}	&"with~you"	\\
3rd Masc.		&~&	\Gal{(:m.Eh}	&"with~him"			&~&	\Gal{(:m.hON}	&"with~them"	\\
3rd Fem.		&~&	\Gal{(:m>ah}	&"with~her"			&~&	\Gal{(:m.hEN}	&"with~them"	\\
\end{tabu}
\end{center}


\subsection{\textit{`al}}

The particle \Gal{(al} means "upon," "against," or "concerning" depending on context.

\Gal{yAtEb (al kEpah} = "Sitting upon the rock."

It, too, can take on Pronominal Suffixes, however make note that it takes their \textit{plural} forms.

\begin{center}
\noindent\begin{tabu} to \textwidth {r c c c c}
~			&	\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textit{\textbf{Singular}}}	& \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textit{\textbf{Plural}}}			\\
1st Com.		&	\Gal{(alayy} 			& \textit{`alái}		&\Gal{(alEnaN}				& \textit{`alenan}	\\
2nd	Masc.	&	\Gal{(alEK} 			& \textit{`alék}		&\Gal{(alEkON}				& \textit{`alekón}	\\
2nd	Fem.		&	\Gal{(alayyK}			& \textit{`aláiḵ}		&\Gal{(alEkEN}				& \textit{`alekén}	\\
3rd	Masc.	&	\Gal{(alOI} 			& \textit{`alóï}		&\Gal{(alEhON}				& \textit{`alehón}	\\
3rd	Fem.		&	\Gal{(alEh} 			& \textit{`aléh}		&\Gal{(alEhEN}				& \textit{`alehén}	\\
\end{tabu}
\end{center}


\subsection{\textit{la'}}

The particle \Gal{la)} is the Negative Particle, representing "no" or "not." It is used as a generic negative:

\Gal{):mar lEh la)} = "He said to him, `No!'"

\noindent
And can be casually used in simple sentences:

\Gal{la) s:par hU)} or \Gal{la) hU) s:par} = "It's not a book."

\noindent
When negating Verbs, it usually comes directly before:

\Gal{la) ):tah lI} = "He didn't come to me."

\noindent
When combined with the word \Gal{k:lOM} ("something") as in \Gal{la) k:lOM} it means "nothing," or can be used to strengthen a negation:

\Gal{la) ):mar lEh k:lOM} = "He didn't say anything to him." or "He didn't speak to him at all."

\noindent
When used in the series \Gal{w:la)} ...\Gal{la)} it means "neither... nor":

\Gal{la) d:N w:la) d:N} = "Neither this, nor that."

\noindent
When combined with the particle \Gal{d:-} it means "without":

\Gal{d:la) mazON} = "Without food."

And it is used in a variety of other ways in combination with other particles as described in their own sections.



\subsection{\textit{diḏ-}}

The particle \Gal{dId-} originates from the classical \Gal{dIl-}\footnote{literally, "That which is to..."} and is only used when a Possessive Suffix, for some reason, won't work. It indicates simple possession where there is no Noun, or where using a Possessive Suffix would be awkward such as on a loan-word whose ending wouldn't fit normal Declensions.

\begin{center}
\noindent\begin{tabu} to 3.5in {l c X[r] | X[l] c X[r] | X[l] c}
~			&~&	\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textit{Singular}}		&~&	\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textit{Plural}}	\\
1st Com.		&~&	\Gal{dIdI}		&"mine"			&~&	\Gal{dIdaN}	&"ours"	\\
2nd Masc.		&~&	\Gal{dIdaK}	&"yours"			&~&	\Gal{dIdkON}	&"yours"	\\
2nd Fem.		&~&	\Gal{dIdEK}	&"yours"			&~&	\Gal{dIdkEN}	&"yours"	\\
3rd Masc.		&~&	\Gal{dIdEh}	&"his"			&~&	\Gal{dIdhON}	&"theirs"	\\
3rd Fem.		&~&	\Gal{dIdah}	&"hers"			&~&	\Gal{dIdhEN}	&"theirs"	\\
\end{tabu}
\end{center}


\subsection{\textit{kal}}

The particle \Gal{kal} \textit{kal} means "all."

It can take the Definite ending like a Masculine Declension C Noun, lengthening the \Gal{•a} vowel to \Gal{O} and it becomes \Gal{kOlAh} \textit{kolah} meaning "everything."\footnote{This is in contrast to other Aramaic dialects where "everything" is usually some form of \Gal{kl md(M} or \Gal{klmdM}.}
