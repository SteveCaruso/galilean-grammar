## Talmud Bavli

## Eruvin 53b

> בְּנֵי גָלִיל דְּלָא דָּיְיקִי לִישָּׁנָא מַאי הִיא? (דְּתַנְיָא) דְּהָהוּא בַּר גָּלִילָא [דַּהֲוָה קָאָזֵיל] וַאֲמַר לְהוּ: ״אֲמַר לְמַאן, אֲמַר לְמַאן?״ אֲמַרוּ לֵיהּ: גָּלִילָאָה שׁוֹטֶה, חֲמַר לְמִירְכַּב אוֹ חֲמַר לְמִישְׁתֵּי? עֲמַר לְמִילְבַּשׁ אוֹ אִימַּר לְאִיתְכַּסָּאָה? 

The people of the Galilee are not precise in their speech. Why is this? There was a certain Galilean who would walk and say to people: Who has [an] אמר? Who has [an] אמר? They said to him: Foolish Galilean! What do you mean? A donkey [*ḥamār*] to ride? Or wine [*ḥəmar*] to drink? Wool [*ˁamar*] to wear? Or a lamb [*'immar*] to slaughter? 

> הָהִיא אִיתְּתָא דְּבָעֲיָא לְמֵימַר לַחֲבֶרְתַּהּ: ״תָּאִי דְּאוֹכְלִיךְ חֲלָבָא״, אֲמַרָה לַהּ: ״שְׁלוּכָתִי, תּוֹכְלִיךָ לָבִיא״.

There was a certain woman who wanted to say to her friend: My neighbor, come and I will feed you milk [*ta’i de’okhlikh ḥalava*]; but instead she said to her: May a lioness eat you [*tokhlikh lavya*]!

> הַהִיא אִתְּתָא דְּאָתְיָא לְקַמֵּיהּ דְּדַיָּינָא, אֲמַרָה לֵיהּ: ״מָרִי כִּירִי, תַּפְלָא הֲוָית לִי וְגַנְבוּךְ מִין. וְכַדּוּ הֲווֹת, דְּכַד שָׁדְרוּ לָךְ עִילָּוַיהּ — לָא מָטֵי כַּרְעָיךְ אַאַרְעָא״. 

This one is tough to explain, as there are a lot of moving contextual parts...

<!-- There was a certain woman who came before a judge. She said to him: My lord! My servant! [*kiri*],^[They didn't realize that כִּירִי was a common way to say "Oh my master!" in a number of other dialects.] I had a beam and they stole you from me [tafla hawait li ugenavukh min]. And it was so [large], that when they would hang you upon it, your feet would not reach the ground. [Instead of I had a board, and they stole it from me.] -->


## Megillah 24b

> לֹא אַנְשֵׁי בֵּית שְׁאָן וְלֹא אַנְשֵׁי (בֵּית) חֵיפָה וְלֹא אַנְשֵׁי טִבְעוֹנִין, מִפְּנֵי שֶׁקּוֹרִין לָאַלְפִין עַיְינִין וְלָעַיְינִין אַלְפִין

No one of Beit She’an, nor anyone of Beit Haifa, nor anyone of Tivonin [*all of these places being in Galilee*] may pass before the ark because they pronounce alef as ayin and ayin as alef [*and will therefore mess up the prayers and offend God like the others mentioned earlier in the passage*].
